120	Would you like to visit Chaos Castle, the arena of the gods? There is no better place to prove your strength. Why don't you listen to what I have to say and then decide? (Level 50-399)	2	19
121	Chaos Castle is a battle field created by Lugard, the god of the heaven world, and Secrarium, the god of the underworld, for the balance of good and evil in this world. However, travelers started going to Chaos Castle and fighting on the side of Lugard, tipping the balance in disfavor of Secrarium.	2	19
122	To restore balance to the battle event, Secrarium made Lugard an offer and suggested implementation of a new rule. This rule was for everyone participating in the event to wear guardsman's armor. Lugard, believing the offer to be fair, accepted.	2	19
123	Unfortunately, Secrarium was betting that darkness in the hearts of the travelers would ultimately lead to hostility and discord among them. Lugard was also aware of the travelers' dark side, but his trust in them didn't waver. Ultimately, the travelers did begin to feud with one another like the dark god had anticipated, and Chaos Castle became ever more... chaotic.	2	19
124	It's very easy to enter Chaos Castle. Simply right-click on your Armor of Guardsman at the appropriate times (12:00am, 14:00pm, 16:00pm, 18:00pm, 20:00pm, and 22:00pm) to enter. Players in designated locations, such as a PC cafe, will have more opportunities to enter.	2	19
125	You will stand by for about a minute before actually entering. The event starts once this standby time passes. Once it does start, travelers and corrupt guardsmen will fight each other to the death in a no-holds-barred melee. 	2	19
126	It doesn't matter with the travelers, but you have to be careful when you kill a corrupt guardsman. Corrupt guardsmen will explode and may even push you off the arena. If this happens, you will be disqualified.	2	19
127	If you want to find out when you can enter, simply move your mouse over the Armor of Guardsman. If you want to enter, simply right-click on the armor at a designated time. Come see me when you have time, and I will give you a quest that will earn you the item needed to enter the event.	2	19
128	If you understand everything, receive the reward.	4	19

268	Have you ever heard of Blood Castle's barrier? Would you like to hear Archangel's request to help defend Blood Castle's barrier and join in the fight for the castle? (Level 50-399)	2	42
269	I will tell you then. Devildom's royal guards, who were summoned when Kundun succumbed to Secrarium, posed a great threat to the heaven world. To protect their base, the Twelve Saints formed a barrier around Blood Castle. 	2	42
270	Kundun, however, must've anticipated such a move. He hid beyond the range of the barrier and eliminated the Twelve Saints as soon as the barrier was formed. Luckily, Archangel evaded that peril and sacrificed himself for the barrier. 	2	42
271	It's easy to join Blood Castle. It will be held every 2 hours from 00:30. 5 minutes before the Blood Castle takes place, take an Invisibility Cloak that fits the your level and go to the event map square.

274	To find out when you can enter, simply press the F1 key. If you want to enter, take an Invisibility Cloak that's right for your level to the Messenger of Archangel before the scheduled start time.

414	Are you familiar with a hidden training ground known as Devil Square? It's an opportune place to develop your skills. Why don't you listen to what I have to say and then decide? (Level 50-199)	2	65
415	Devil Square is the place where the Elf Tree once stood. The Elf Tree was created by the mother of all Elves, an underground Elf known as Aria. This tree had the ability to produce Elves regularly. Then Secrarium tricked Lugard and appeared in Noria, at the location of the Elf Tree.	2	65
416	Having set his eyes on the tree's power of birth, Secrarium corrupted the Elf Tree and transformed it into an Immoral Tree that gave birth to monsters.  The monsters horde grew to astronomical proportions, and the kingdoms of the MU continent combined their forces to entrap the immoral tree in a space of nothingness. 	2	65
417	Monsters, however, continued to spawn at regular intervals from the spot where the tree once stood. After careful consideration, the queen of the Elves decided to make a training arena of this place for travelers.	2	65
418	It's very easy to enter Devil Square. It can be entered every four hours from 3:00 a.m. and on (3:00 a.m., 7:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m., 7:00 p.m., and 11:00 p.m.). To enter, take a Devil's Invitation that's right for your level to Charon in Noria five minutes before a scheduled entry time and ask to join. Charon will then send you to Devil Square. 	2	65
419	You'll stand by for about a minute before actually entering. Once this standby time passes, monsters will start to appear. The monsters will continue to attack for ten minutes, and killing them will earn you points. If you score high enough, you might even receive a reward. 	2	65
420	You'll face a steady stream of powerful monsters at Devil Square. Forming a party with other travelers before entering will give you a better chance of survival. 	2	65

443	Devil Square is the place where the Elf Tree once stood. The Elf Tree was created by the mother of all Elves, an underground Elf known as Aria. This tree had the ability to produce Elves regularly. Then Secrarium tricked Lugard and appeared in Noria, at the location of the Elf Tree.	2	69
444	Having set his eyes on the tree's power of birth, Secrarium corrupted the Elf Tree and transformed it into an Immoral Tree that gave birth to monsters.  The monsters horde grew to astronomical proportions, and the kingdoms of the MU continent combined their forces to entrap the immoral tree in a space of nothingness. 	2	69
445	Monsters, however, continued to spawn at regular intervals from the spot where the tree once stood. After careful consideration, the queen of the Elves decided to make a training arena of this place for travelers.	2	69
446	It's very easy to enter Devil Square. It can be entered every four hours from 3:00 a.m. and on (3:00 a.m., 7:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 3:00 p.m., 7:00 p.m., and 11:00 p.m.). To enter, take a Devil's Invitation that's right for your level to Charon in Noria five minutes before a scheduled entry time and ask to join. Charon will then send you to Devil Square. 	2	69
447	You'll stand by for about a minute before actually entering. Once this standby time passes, monsters will start to appear. The monsters will continue to attack for ten minutes, and killing them will earn you points. If you score high enough, you might even receive a reward. 	2	69
448	You'll face a steady stream of powerful monsters at Devil Square. Forming a party with other travelers before entering will give you a better chance of survival. 	2	69

I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Deruvish. I came after Vanert in search of Secromicon Fragment. I'm the only one left now.	2	89
563	Hmm... As soon as we got to the island, we were attacked by element monsters. We lost a lot of adventurers from that. Even the survivors left the island with Vanert. I was left behind with a few others to save the other members.	2	89
564	From what I have found out, I think this island was a peaceful place with spirits. Something must have happened to transform the spirits to monsters. However, when they transformed into monsters, they still had the abilities from when they were spirits. They are still dangerous.	2	89

566	Listen to the Only Survivor of the Adventurers	5	89

If you want to continue adventuring, you can get Muren's Book of Magic Pentagram item. Please hunt down monsters in Atlans and Acheron Alkmar,  Ubaid area to find Muren's Book of Magic. 	2	90
569	You cannot fight against elemental monsters without Pentagram items. Please reconsider.	2	90
570	You must have Pentagram items to fight against elemental monsters.	3	90
571	Well done.	4	90
572	Get the Pentagram	5	90
573	Errtel Item	1	91
574	You brought Pentagram items? Now you can fight against elemental monsters much better. Let me explain the elements and Pentagram items to you. Please check the Pentagram items that you have already. It must have an element.	2	91
575	There are 5 elements in total. Fire, water, earth, wind, and darkness. The 5 elements have strengths and weaknesses. Fire is weak against water. But it is strong against darkness. Similarly, water is strong against fire and weak against earth. Other elements have weaknesses and strengths shown in order. Once you have Pentagram in your inventory, you will have an element. Additional damage will be added depending on the type. 	2	91
576	You can use the spirit's power. Let's try to kill the monsters by using the elements. Kill 20 Devil Fairies.	2	91

581	You can enhance Pentagram items by using Errtel. Oh! Of course, you can enhance the Pentagram itself and strengthen the elemental power. But if you use Errtel, you can add even more powerful options. 	2	92
582	If you Alt + Right-click an unequipped Pentagram item, the attribute window will open. You can use the Errtel in an empty socket. But there are limitations to the types of jewels that you can equip in sockets.	2	92
583	Socket 1 is for Anger, Socket 2 is for Blessing, Socket 3 is for Integrity, Socket 4 is for Divinity, and Socket 5 is for Radiance. You can unequip jewels, but sometimes they disappear.	2	92
584	You can make an Errtel by combining Mithril and Jewel of Bless. Ok! Shall we go and get the Mithril? If you bring Mithril, I will teach you how to make an Errtel.	2	92
585	Hunt down monsters to get a Mithril.	3	92
586	Well done.	4	92

590	Once you have all the ingredients, try making an Errtel. You can make an Errtel from Spirit Adniel. She's one of the few spirits that haven't turned into a monster.	2	93
591	You must have elemental powder to make an elemental capsule.	3	93
592	Well done.	4	93
593	Get elemental powder	5	93
594	Secrets of the Acheron Monsters	1	94
595	Let me explain to you how an Errtel upgrade works. There are level up and rank up for Errtels. For level up, you need the Elemental Rune. For rank up, you need 2 Errtels + 7 with the same rank.	2	94
596	Level up enhances the current rank of the Errtel option. Rank up is an upgrade that adds an option to the jewel. You could say that rank up is better. You can level up to Level 10. You can rank up to Rank 3.	2	94
597	The Errtel of Anger you have right now only has the option of adding attack damage. But if you rank it up and make it Rank 2, it gets an additional option. When it's Rank 3, it will have maximum of 3 options.  Also...	2	94
598	If you collect similar options, you can even gain a Set Effect.  Now, if you go and kill 20 Elemental Beasts, I will show you a second Errtel.	2	94
